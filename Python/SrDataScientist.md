I am an experienced scientist in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing and data science. 
I have research experience in the following learning areas where I got my masters and doctoral degree from Germany: 
Ensemble Learning (Multiple Classifier Systems), Multi-View Learning, Multi-Class Decomposition (mainly using the hierarchical approach), 
Semi-Supervised Learning (Learning from unlabeled data), Domain Adaptation, Active Learning, Missing Data Imputation and improving 
comprehensibility of neural networks through rule extraction. I have experience in publishing my research contributions in the form of a
book chapter, more than 13 peer reviewed articles in international conferences and journals and four patents. In addition to the research
experience, I have experience in working closely with product teams to deliver advanced technologies that extract useful and actionable 
insights from unstructured text such as search queries, social network messages, product reviews, customer feedback. My main passion are 
in domain adaptation, language modeling, information extraction, word-sense disambiguation, topic modeling and detection, sentiment 
classification and cross-lingual text classification. On my way to build this expertise, I have developed my software development and 
problem solving skills using C/C++, C# and Java and data science languages such as R, Python and Matlab in addition to web development 
languages such as HTML, JSP, and ASP.NET.

On the academic side, I served as an assistant professor at Cairo University with experience in teaching undergraduate and graduate 
courses and mentoring/supervising students in graduation projects and master theses.
